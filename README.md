# UIREesdevHack-UNIPAYS

This repository contains all the files for the final version of the UNIPAYS application. I built this application to solve the financial problems students face on campus. Aside fees payment and getting loans, this application can transfer money, you can fund your account, buy airtime, buy data, buy food tickets, etc. I built this project for the UIRESDEV Hackathon. For this project, I hacked solo and made the designs and development of this application all by myself. I developed this app in about 3 weeks, with just my Android phone. The application is written in Vanilla HTML, Vanilla CSS and Vanilla JAVASCRIPT. I didn't use any framework or library for this application.
